# Games

The overview table gives you common info about games you have in the TVMS.

{% hint style="info" %}
The fact that a game is in the list **does not mean** that it is available to the user, it may contain test games too. To make it available, you have to create a [bundle](games.md#bundles) for a [product](../inventory/inventory.md)
