## Subscriptions

This page contains all the created subscriptions in the system. By design, subscriptions are divided into _paid_ and _free_, _base_ and _extra_ products, so it gives you flexibility of commercial management. You can create free trial subscription to attract the customers and paid subscription with full content to sell.

{% hint style="info" %}
Their presense doesn't mean they are available for purchasing, so you can create test or sandbox subscription for internal use only.
