# Email gateways

Email gateway allows to perform **email operations** between end users and your service.

It’s required by **TVMS and app** to perform **communication** with customers.

TVMS supports **two** gateways: _SendGrid_ and _Mailgun._

Click Setup Gateway of a required one, e.g. **SendGrid**

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, you need to have a working account of a certain email gateway
{% endhint %}

Specify required information, in this case this is _Name, API Key, Verified Sender Email_. Refer to your Stripe account to get the key.

Same approach for Mailgun. Once it’s added, you may refer to My Payment Gateways to check it’s details.
