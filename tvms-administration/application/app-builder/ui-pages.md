# UI Pages

TVMS provides a very flexible tool to customize the user interface. Simply drag and drop the tiles from left to the right. Put them in a desired place and check how it looks in the app. Make your app look really individual.

Select a page that you want to customize. Navigate through the tabs on the right side, find possible options for Header, Hero, Content and Footer. Check different options, how it looks in App Builder and check the application.

The tiles have additional options in overlay buttons - click them to learn them. Check the available options, some of them may be used in different parts. Feel free to play around and donâ€™t be afraid of creating new.
