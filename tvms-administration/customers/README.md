# Customers

In the TVMS  the customer list serves as a central hub for managing user information and interactions within the OTT ecosystem. This comprehensive database includes details of customers who have registered through the webshop, been created manually by administrators, or integrated via API. Each entry contains essential attributes such as names, last names, and login credentials, with passwords securely hashed to ensure user privacy and data protection.

The customer list is designed to provide a clear overview of various customer properties, facilitating efficient management of subscriptions and user accounts. For instance, each customer profile includes information about their current subscriptions, allowing administrators to monitor active plans and renewal dates seamlessly.

Additionally, the system tracks the extend date for subscriptions, which helps in managing renewals and preventing service interruptions. Another vital aspect of customer management in TVMS is the ability to view the list of devices in use by each customer. This feature enables administrators to understand user behavior better and address any potential issues related to device compatibility or usage limits.
