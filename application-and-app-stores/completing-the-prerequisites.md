# Completing the prerequisites

In order to create an app, we need you to complete the following steps.

<summary>Provide us with the desired app name</summary>

## Select an App Name

Most likely you have already selected the name for your future app. But if you’re still wondering how to name an app, here you can find some best practices and useful tips.

* **Reflect your app’s core features** Highlight what is great about your app, what is its main purpose, how does it help users?
* **Choose a name that is searchable** A large portion of downloads are the result of a simple search. The best way to get organic traffic is then to try and come up with short phrases that people are likely to use when searching for the service you are providing. Then choose a name that aligns with those keywords.
* **Check the availability of the name.** Make sure that your app name or even part of the name isn’t already used. This applies not only to the Stores but also to domain names and social media.
* **Align it with a domain** Most likely, you will want to have a landing page that corresponds with your mobile app. Try to choose a name that is available, but that also has the same name available as a web domain.
* **Play on words** Sometimes, a play on words can provide you with the perfect app name. Maybe you can’t get the exact word that describes your app, but differentiating slightly can give you a catchy twist and open you up to more options. But don’t go too far. Your users still need to be able to find your app.
* **Create meaning** A name carries meanings. If you can’t find one word to clearly reflect your app, try to compound words (noun+noun, noun+adjective, etc) to create a more comprehensive name. Another good tip is to use capitalization or lower-case lettering and keep it simple so that you’re not overwhelming your users.
* **Two-part head** A good technique is to choose an app name using a two-part head, which would describe both the purpose of your application and its’ functionality, such as Evernote for example.
* **Keep it short and memorable** Ideally, you want a short name that is unique and memorable. Many successful apps have managed to find a good one-word name, helping users easily remember them: YouTube, Netflix, etc.
*   **Specific case: creating an app for a brand name**

    Of course, the scenario is a bit different if you are creating an app for an existing brand or business. In this case, naming your app is the easiest scenario: simply stick to your brand name and add the key feature of your app. Just remember that the name can be truncated. Users will only see the first ten characters or so of your app name when browsing the stores. Also, think of how the name will appear on the screen of the phone. Bear in mind that the title of your app will appear on the home screen of your users' device where it needs to look nice too.

## Artwork to Build Apps

In order to prepare apps for you, we need the following images: [graphics.zip](https://4261934337-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MVGM3ojt1Ms1yW8BIPG%2Fuploads%2Fcx92Z3jaJs6xlCFQWGdp%2Fgraphics.zip?alt=media\&token=1fc9e8a2-f079-4530-85ce-cac950b19185)

These images are:

* a square shape image with your logo on a transparent background (e.g. square\_transparent.png);
* a rectangular shape image with your logo on a transparent background (e.g. rectangular\_transparent.png);
* a 1920x1080px or 3840x2160px rectangular shape image with background only (e.g. background 2160p.png);
* optionally, a square shape background image1024x1024px can be provided. If not, then rectacgular background will be used;
* other logos if any.

Please keep in mind, if Android TV app is required, then your logo (image square\_transparent.png or image rectangular\_transparent.png) should display your app title as a text, otherwise Android TV app will be rejected. For example, our app’s title is MwareTV and the image rectangular\_transparent.png displays such title as a text.

<summary>Prepare developer accounts</summary>

Setting up your Developer Accounts and granting us access is a crucial part of the process.

If you're setting up your Developer Accounts for the first time, you can find below all the information you need. If you already have Developer Accounts, please review the information below to find how to grant us with access.

We suggest you start with creating your Developer Accounts at start of the project, to prevent delays later on.

Your Developer Accounts should be associated with the same legal entity or organization, who has the rights to distribute the content.

To start enrollment for the Apple Developer Program, [visit this page](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/), log in with your Apple ID, and enroll as an **Organization**.

It is very important to enroll as an **Organization** because Individual accounts have limitations on Apple side, and you won't be able to share your team's development resources with our team. Thus, we won't be able to build an app for you.
