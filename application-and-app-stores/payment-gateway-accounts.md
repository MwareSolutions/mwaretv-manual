# Payment gateway accounts

## Stripe

Register your Stripe account: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)

### Activate your account

In order to activate your account, fill out the account application available the link: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding). Specify there basic information about your business, product and personal info. Once your account is activated, you start accepting payments.

{% hint style="info" %}
After activation you can't change the country. If you need to work with different countries, create a new account.
{% endhint %}

Note that Stripe follows “Know Your Customer” (KYC) and collection information about users. It's needed to match the regulatory rules and prevent a fraud. They may contact you in order to confirm the information you provided before.

**To get a secret key in a sandbox:**

1. In the Developers Dashboard, open the **API keys** tab.
2. In the **Standard keys** > **Secret key** row, click **Reveal test key**.
3. Copy the API key and paste in the TVMS. It's better to save it somewhere else in a secure place.

**To get a secret key in live:**

For security, in live mode Stripe only shows you a secret or restricted API key one time. Store the key in a safe place where you won’t lose it. To help yourself remember where you stored it, you can leave a note on the key in the Dashboard. If you lose the key, you can roll it or delete it and create another.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can't reveal a live mode secret key that you created**

After you create a secret or restricted API key in live mode, we display the value before you save it. You must copy the value before saving it because you can’t reveal it later. You can only reveal a default secret key or a key generated by a scheduled roll.
{% endhint %}

* In the Developers Dashboard, open the **API keys** tab.
* In the **Standard keys** list or **Restricted keys** list, in the row for the key you want to reveal, click **Reveal live key**.
* Copy the key value by clicking it.
* Save the key value.
* Click **Hide test key**.
* Click the overflow menu (\*\*\*) next to the key, then select **Edit key**.
* In the **Note** field, enter the location where you saved the key, then click **Save**.
