# Push Notifications Gateway

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a Firebase project and grant MwareTV access, so we can set up push notifications for your mobile apps.

1.  Go to [Firebase Console ](https://console.firebase.google.com/)and sign in. We recommend using the same account you used to create your developer account on the Google Play Console. **Select Get Started with a Firebase Project**.\

2.  Once youâ€™re signed in, create a new project. For consistency, we recommend naming the Firebase project the same as your app.\

Once these steps are completed, we will be able to configure push notifications for your mobile apps and include this feature in the next app release.&#x20;
